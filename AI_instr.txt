For automatic captures update the naming to the following:
 
 Location can be RGT or LFT - right is rgt and left is lft
 seq can be 01 or 02 - each location camera has this value.
hhmmaa ia military hour, 2 digit minute, 2 digit seconds
 auto-id - this is incremented from the most recent files auto-id value. Call the api endpoint /getautoid

 this is an issue with the counter. The incrementing of the counter should be after the right side completes a flush sequence. Then the flush counter should increment +1.

 For some reason when the left captures a photo while in automatic mode, the first images have flush number set to 0000. It should begin with 0001, so something is wrong withthe logic here.
